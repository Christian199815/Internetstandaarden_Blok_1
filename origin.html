                        Cocktails were initially inspired by British punches, which contained spirits, fruit juices, and
                        spices in big bowls. The term “cocktail” was first seen on March 17, 1798, as referenced from a
                        newspaper.
                        Though the origin of mixed drinks can be traced back to the 17th century, it wasn’t clear where,
                        who, and how the “original” cocktail was created.
                        The first-ever reference to cocktails appeared in a spoof editorial in the Farmer’s Cabinet
                        (Amherst, New Hampshire, April 28, 1803).
                        It talked of a “lounger” who, while nursing an 11 a.m. hangover, “Drank a glass of cocktail –
                        excellent for the head…”

                    <p>
                        As cocktails made their way into becoming a social badge of honour during the Shakespearean
                        times,
                        developments into the mood-altering effects of booze turned mixing drinks and bartending into
                        big
                        news.
                        Jerry Thomas or Professor Thomas, an American bartender, helped define the art of bartending.
                        Using
                        the experience he gained from working all over Europe and America, he wrote “The Bartender’s
                        Guide
                        (or How to Mix Drinks).”
                        It is one of the first comprehensive recipe books that became a standard-bearer for new and
                        experienced bartenders alike, becoming a significant milestone from the Golden Age of the
                        history of
                        cocktails.

                        In the mid-20th century, cocktail drinks took a step back as drug cultures overtook them.
                        However, around the 90s, people like Dale Degroff of New York’s famous Rainbow Room revived the
                        classic cocktail culture from Professor Thomas’ time.
                        Degroff’s craft cocktail movement brought historical values and strict quality standards back to
                        a
                        formerly devolved industry. This new era saw drinks like The Pink Squirrel and shooters such as
                        Training Bra cocktails.
                        Mixology also became popular throughout this period. To this day, bartenders have been
                        flourishing.
                        As some of Thomas’ original cocktail recipes disappear, new ones such as the Gin Basil Smash
                        emerge
                        daily, keeping the cocktail culture alive.
