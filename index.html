                    <h2>Where does this love come from?</h2>
                    <p>To be honest the passion I got for cocktails didn't originate from me, but from a mate of mine.
                    </p>
                    <p>He started to experiment with the differents kinds of liqours and ways to put them together.</p>
                    <p>But for one to experiment, one also needs a test rabbit to know if it is a good cocktail or not.
                    </p>
                    <p>That is where I come in.</p>

                    <p>For a test rabbit as myself, a test moment wouldn't just be a moment to test 1 new recipe</p>
                    <p>No no no, on such occasion i would be bombarded with a bunch of new recipes to try</p>
                    <p>But this moments are still really fun, for as the bartender gets drunk with you</p>
                    <p>So to say if at this moment i wouldn't be in love with these drinks, i would after what comes
                        next

                    <p>Up at the moment of testing only a few evenings getting wasted</p>
                    <p>Not much later after my mate becoming a bartender at the best cocktailbar in Utrecht</p>
                    <p>The occasional free drink, and crazy stories of his colleagues</p>
                    <p>But to see where the spark of cocktail love electrified me</p>

                    <h2>This love = opportunity!</h2>
                    <p>While on a way in the far lands of Austria, we encountered an opportunity</p>
                    <p>A Burger Boutique that wanted to sell high quality cocktails, got my mate and I as their
                        customers
                    </p>
                    <p>After a good conversation, we made a deal to give them a workshop</p>
                    <p>And without them knowing a newly designed menu</p>
                    <p>So i my mates way of his soon to be proffesion, and my way of way design</p>
                    <p>I totally fell in love with these magical drinks</p>
